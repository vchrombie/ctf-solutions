Hello Angry Employer,

I will not stand for this, it was a simple mistake that anyone could have
made.
If anything, I should blame your company training!
I'm leaking all confidential information, on purpose this time.

Hope you like being the center of attention on infosec twitter!

Hello Mr. imdeveloper123,

Are you kidding me? You leaked company info by making the dot-files you use
for work purposes *public* on your GitHub?
It should come at no surprise that as of the time of writing this email,
you are permanently released from your current job.

Please talk to HR ASAP.
